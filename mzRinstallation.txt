### mzR installation
### Shiv (04-Nov-2014)


I've managed a dirty workaround instead that works. 
Basically, I did 3 consecutive installs of netcdf, configured each time for 
my ~/usr directory, ~/usr/bin, and ~/usr/bin/lib64/R. Interestingly, the ncdf library in R 
loaded fine with just the ~/usr install, but mzR (and xcms) required additionally the other 
two locations to install properly.

This was all with the latest netCDF build (4.2) with the --disable-netcdf-4 option

Reference: http://metabolomics-forum.com/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=271 

From the /data/metagenome_data/Desktop/netcdf-4.3.0 folder install mzR at the above 3 locations 
(and any locations suggested by R, it would be shown as error during mzR installation)

Installation

Step 1: ./configure --prefix=/usr --disable-netcdf-4 option
Step 2: make check install
Step 3: Before starting R, as su use 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/data/metagenome_data/netcdf/lib/'
Step 4: Start R
Step 5: Install mzR and xcms from bioconductor using the instructions at the bioconductor website
